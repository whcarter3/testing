    title "Howl"
	genre "Poetry"
	author_name "Allen Ginsberg"
	summary "Howl appears to be a sprawling, disorganized poem. But it's not. It consists of three sections. Each of these sections is a prolonged 'riff' on a single subject. You could even think of the poem as three enormous run-on sentences. The first section is by far the longest."
